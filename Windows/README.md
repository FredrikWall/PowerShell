# Windows

These are my functions and scripts for working with Windows.

All functions are stored in a separate .ps1 file.

Invoke-CleanTemp.ps1
--------------------
This function will clean the ***current users*** temp folder, plus the ***c:\windows\temp*** folder.

It has support for closing a set of applications first to be able to remove as much files and folders as possible.

And It has support for ***-WhatIf***
