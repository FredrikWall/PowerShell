# Windows

These are my functions, scripts and special files for working with Windows.

All functions are stored in a separate .ps1 file.

With an standard example how to use them.

So almost all of the PowerShell files can be runned as they are.

Get-PingStatus.ps1
------------------
One of my oldest functions.
I used It before Test-Connection came and sometimes I use It today too.

Get-Windows10BuildInformation.ps1
---------------------------------
This function will show information either from the local computers Windows 10 build numbers.

Or from a specified build numer with the parameter ***-OSBuildVersion***

The information will be download by default from this GitHub repository from the file ***Windows10BuildInformation.json***.

But you can use your own file generated by the function ***Get-Windows10ReleaseInformation*** if you want.

Just name It ***Windows10BuildInformation.json*** and put It in the same folder as this function/script.

Get-Windows10ReleaseInformation.ps1
-----------------------------------

Invoke-CleanTemp.ps1
--------------------
This function will clean the ***current users*** temp folder, plus the ***c:\windows\temp*** folder as standard.

Now It also has support for ***All Users*** temp folders with the parameter ***-AllUsers***.
With this parameter you will do a nice clean on a computer with lots of users.

It has support for closing a set of applications first to be able to remove as much files and folders as possible.

And It has support for ***-WhatIf***

Invoke-PnPReScan.ps1
--------------------

Windows10BuildInformation.json
